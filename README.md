# Laptop-Price-Prediction
Our project addresses the issue of overpaying for laptops by providing a model that generates estimated prices based on user-specified specifications. Leveraging data sourced from the category of laptops available at Amazon, we aim to empower buyers to make informed purchasing decisions, ensuring they get the best value for their investment.
